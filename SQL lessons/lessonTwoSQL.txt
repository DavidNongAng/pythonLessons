What is SQLite?

SQLite is a database engine that allows users to interact with a relational database.
    - a database is stored in a single file. (trait that distinguishes from other database engines.)
    - allows for accessibility
    - ability to access and manipulate a database without involving a server application.
    - used for testing, development, etc...

Drawbacks:
    - to maintain integrity of data, only one user can can write to the file at a time).
    - does not validate data types.

Ex:

CREATE TABLE celebs (
   id INTEGER,
   name TEXT,
   age INTEGER
);

    - SQLite will not reject values of the wrong type.
