JOIN customers                                          #Combine the information from orders with customers.
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;        #specifies how to combine the two tables.

SELECT orders.order_id,
   customers.customer_name                              # . makes sure our request is unambiguous for the columns.
FROM orders
JOIN customers
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
